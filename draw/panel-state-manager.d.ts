 * Saves relevant enhancedTable states so that it can be reset on reload/reopen. A PanelStateManager is linked to a BaseLayer.

 * States to save and reset:
 *      - displayed rows (on symbology and layer visibility updates)
 *      - column filters
 *      - column sorts
 *      - whether table maximized is in maximized or split view
